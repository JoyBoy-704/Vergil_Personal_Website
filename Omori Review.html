  <h1>OMORI: One of my most memorable gaming experiences</h1>

  <p>
    OMORI is tagged as psychological horror on Steam, and while this is not immediately evident in the
    colourful handdrawn backgrounds and happy feeling it evokes in the first few hours of the game, it is clear that
    there is something more sinister beneath the gilded surface.
  </p>
  <p>
    The game has a trigger warning before the title screen, and I advise you to take it seriously.
    The biggest strength of the game is obviously in its story, where it paints the picture of what trauma
    and isolationist tendencies do to an individual. The slow severing of childhood friendships, how different people
    deal with grief from the loss of a loved one are explored more deeply than any other media I have consumed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another theme of the game is how grief isolates the affected individuals, which this quote from Steven
    Erikson can explain better than I can:
    <br>
    <em>“Survivors do not mourn together. They each mourn alone, even when in the same place. Grief is the most solitary of all feelings.
      Grief isolates, and every ritual, every gesture, every embrace, is a hopeless effort to break through that
      isolation.
      None of it works. The forms crumble and dissolve.
      To face death is to stand alone.”</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    OMORI makes you extremely attached to the affected characters in the game, both their dream as well as their
    real world personas, and in the second half of the game, the loss they have faced hits like a truck, and the final
    five or so hours twist the knife it has already planted in your heart. I might even go so far as to say
    that anyone who doesn't cry while playing this game has no heart.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for the aesthetics, the art style fits the game perfectly, almost every track in the OST is a banger, and
    the combat system is more inventive than in most RPGMaker games. It is safe for me to say that OMORI is my
    personal GOTY of 2020, and it has given me perhaps my most memorable gaming experience.
